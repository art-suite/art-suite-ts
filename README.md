> The Standard Library that aught to exist for JavaScript/TypeScript.

JavaScript/TypeScript is missing a lot of fundamental, consistent tooling that other languages take for granted:

- runtime typing: e.g. consistent way to identify types at runtime
- containers and iteration
  - full comprehensions support (powerfully create new containers from other containers)
  - common container tools: merge, compact, flatten, compactFlatten...
- JSON tooling and TypeScript types
- Time and Date
  - convert between string, integer and Date representations of dates seamlessly
  - time presenters: format-date, "time ago", "time duration"
